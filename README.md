This is my choice for building webapps. The stack:

Go: For the backend
A: Apline.js : For adding interactivity client side
T: Templ,Tailwind :  Templ used for server-side templates combining GO and HTMX/HTML, tailwind for them styles

## Features:

- Reusable Components: This framework comes with its own component library built on top of tailwind. ( Work In Progress )
- Minimalistic: No unnecessary bloat.
- Dynamic with HTMX: HTMX brings interactivity and modern UI experiences without requiring a complex frontend framework.
- Easy Templating: The Templ engine allows for easy and powerful server-side rendering with Go, seamlessly integrating into your backend logic.
